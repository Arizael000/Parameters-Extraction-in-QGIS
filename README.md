# Dam Location Automation Scripts for QGIS 3.4

## Overview
This project includes a set of Python scripts designed to automate geospatial tasks in QGIS 3.4. The main objective is to support dam site selection by extracting relevant topographic and hydrological parameters.

## Features
- Automates repetitive spatial analysis tasks
- Designed specifically for QGIS 3.4
- Enhances decision-making for infrastructure planning

## Use Case
Originally developed as part of my Engineering Thesis, these scripts are intended for researchers, engineers, or GIS analysts working on hydrological studies or dam location planning.

## Requirements
- QGIS 3.4
- Python 3.x

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open QGIS 3.4.
3. Run the scripts through the Python console integrated in QGIS.

## License
